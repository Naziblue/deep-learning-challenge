# Alphabet Soup Charity Neural Network Projects

This repository contains two neural network projects focused on predicting the success of projects funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Projects:

### 1. AlphabetSoupCharity
- **Objective**: Predict the success of grant applications based on input features.
- **Key Techniques**:
    - Data preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
    - Neural Network Model: A deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras with two hidden layers.

### 2. AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization
- **Objective**: Building upon the initial model in `AlphabetSoupCharity`, the goal is to optimize the neural network for better performance.
- **Key Techniques**:
    - Advanced preprocessing: Further refining input data through binning and encoding techniques.
    - Optimized Neural Network: Adjusting the architecture, including the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions.
    - Model Evaluation: Utilizing various plots and metrics to evaluate model performance.




## Recommendations:

While the deep learning model shows promise, further experimentation with other algorithms and more data could enhance performance. For detailed insights, refer to individual project reports within each project directory.
